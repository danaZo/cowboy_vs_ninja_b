/*                        Point.hpp By Dana Zorohov
    ======================================================================
    This class's main goal is saving positions on the game board. 
    The position is given to us as 2 double coordinates that holds the
    position of the unit along the x and y axes accordingly. 
    The Class's library supports the following operations:
    - Constructor: receives the two coordinates. 
    - Distance: receives a point and calculates the distance.  
    - Print: prints the two coordinates between brackets. 
    - moveTowards: receives source point, destination point and distance. 
      The function returns the closest point to the destination point,
      which is at most the given distance from the source point.
      This method is static because it doesnâ€™t depend on any 
      instance-specific data. 
      This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.
